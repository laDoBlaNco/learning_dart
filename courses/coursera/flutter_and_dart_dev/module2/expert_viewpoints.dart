Why is dart the preferred programming language for flutter?
  ▪ compiles efficiently to native code
  ▪ supports cross-platform development
  ▪ supports reactive programming for responsive UI with hot-reload
  ▪ uses a syntax similar to javascript which is easier for some
  
  ▪ modern and powerful programming language developed by flutter
  ▪ backbone of flutter
  ▪ object-oriented principles so easy for someone used to working with OOP
  ▪ Optimized for UI
  ▪ Creates smooth animations and transitions
  ▪ hot reload feature helps with quickly viewing changes

What are the fundamental concepts of dart programming?
  ▪ everything in a variable is an object
  ▪ every object is an instance of a class
  ▪ this includes numbers, functions, and even null if null safety enabled
  ▪ enabling null safety to make a variable 'nullable' is done with a '?'
  ▪ a nullable integer for example can be null or int, this also supports
    generic types like a list of objects

  ▪ Use variables, operators, functions, and classes to build any application
    in flutter
  ▪ Structuring code effectively for readabilty and maintainance
  ▪ Dart's OOP simplifies complex tasks using classes and objects
  ▪ Dart's asynce features like Futures and Streams are great for managing
    network requests

Explain the concept of Dart iterables, iterators, and collections:
  ▪ Collections represent groups of objects called 'elements'
  ▪ Iterables are collections of elements accessed sequentially
  ▪ Iterators provide the interface for accessing said elements
  ▪ For example a list of ints is an iterable collection which uses an
    iterator to move from current to next elements in that list. 

  ▪ Iterables help work with a group of objects
  ▪ Iterators help access items in the iterable
  ▪ Iterators are useful for looping through data
  ▪ Collections manage groups of objects in flutter
  ▪ These concepts are very useful when you are dealing with multiple UI 
    elements that need to be displayed such as a list of Widgets or data
    in the app, etc. 
  ▪ Understanding DSA in Dart is also key to creating small responsive apps
