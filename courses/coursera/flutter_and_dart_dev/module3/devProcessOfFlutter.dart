Module 3 - Development Process of Flutter Apps

How does Flutter help 
  ▪ resource optimization (no need for multiple dev teams)
  ▪ faster developement
  ▪ cost efficiency
  ▪ consistence user experience

Planning and requirement gathering are crucial
  ▪ understanding the apps purpose - clarify objectives
  ▪ identifying the target audience
  ▪ defining the core features and functionalities

Designing
  ▪ User experience (UX)
    ▪ sketch screen connections
    ▪ visualize app flow and user journey
  ▪ user interface (UI)
    ▪ arrange pre-built widgets
    ▪ create beautiful screens
    ▪ custome widgets for a unique look

Setting Flutter environment
  ▪ install flutter sdk
  ▪ https://flutter.dev
  ▪ use vscode

Development
  ▪ coding with dart
    ▪ use dart's easy syntax
    ▪ utilize online resources
  ▪ using widgets
    ▪ everything in flutter is a widget, build UI with widgets
    ▪ widgets can be stateless, stateful (dynamic), and layout
  ▪ implementing features
    ▪ integrate core features
    ▪ add APIs and local storage solutions
    ▪ handling user inputs
    ▪ leverage flutter and dart packages to speed up development

Hot reload feature
  ▪ ensure efficient state management, seeing changes in app instantly
    without restarting it thus losing state
  ▪ handle dynamic data updates
  ▪ maintain a fast development cycle

Testing and debugging
  ▪ Flutter offers tools and libraries for testing and debugging
    ▪ identify and fix bugs
    ▪ prevent crashes
    ▪ ensure smooth user experience
  ▪ offers various testing types
    ▪ Unit testing - individual functions or classes
    ▪ Widget testing - UI components
    ▪ Integration testing - complete app workflow
  ▪ includes debugging tools
    ▪ Android Studio
    ▪ Visual Studio Code
    ▪ Help utilize debug mode, breakpoints, and logs

Optimization - essential to promote efficiency on all devices
  ▪ includes reducing app size and optimize loading
  ▪ enhance performance with optimized widgets and efficient data structures
  ▪ ensure compatibility by conducting tests on various devices and screen sizes

Deployment
  ▪ adhere to store policies
  ▪ prepare marketing materials
  ▪ ensure compliance
  ▪ submit to app stores


Recap:
  ▪ Flutter allows me to build apps for both Android and iOS from a single codebase,
    streamline development and reducing costs
  ▪ Features like hot reload and rich widget library accelerate the development
    process and enhance productivity
  ▪ Flutter offers robust solutions for managing dynamic data and keeping apps
    responsive and efficient
  ▪ Flutter focuses on optimizing app performance and ensuring compatibility before
    deploying to app stores, adhering to guidelines for a smooth lauch
