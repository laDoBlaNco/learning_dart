Dart:
  ▪ Easty to learn language
  ▪ Helps build high-performance, cross-platform applications
  ▪ Provides the foundation for Flutter's rich and interactive UI
  ▪ Help create powerful and efficient Flutter apps
 
Overview of Dart:
  ▪ game changer for mobile devs
  ▪ client-optimized language for fast apps on multiple mobile platforms
  ▪ Designed to build UIs that support smooth and reactive programming
  ▪ Simple and easy-to-use syntax

// function example:

}

void main() {
  print('Hello Dash!\n');

  var name = 'Flutter\n'; // 'var' tells dart to infer the type
  print(name);

/*
The main function:
  ▪ entry point for the dart code execution
  ▪ sets the stage for the rest of the application

The print function:
  ▪ powerfull tool to output text to the console
  ▪ useful for debugging and logging

Core concepts of Dart: Variables
  ▪ Used to store data
  ▪ Type is determined during code compilation
  ▪ Variable type can be determined based on its assigned value
    ▪ type inferrance using 'var'

Core concepts of Dart: Data types
  ▪ int
  ▪ double (floating-point)
  ▪ String (NOTE: capital 'S')
  ▪ bool
  ▪ List (NOTE: capital 'L')
  
Core concepts of Dart: Functions
  ▪ Used to encapsulate resuable pieces of code
  ▪ Can take parameters and return values

Recap:
  ▪ Dart is a client-optimized language for fast apps
  ▪ Flutter uses Dart language to build user interfaces
  ▪ The main function is the entry point of the application
  ▪ The print function in Dart is a powerful tool used to output text to the
    console
  ▪ The fundamental concepts of Dart include variables, data types, and  
    functions
  ▪ Variables in Dart are used to store data
  ▪ Dart supports data types, including int, double, String, bool, and List
  ▪ Functions are used to encapsulate reusable pieces of code
