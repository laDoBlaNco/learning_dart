# LEARNING DART AND FLUTTER
This repository is dedicated to my learning of Dart and in the longer run Flutter. 

## PURPOSE

I'm coming back to Dart/Flutter after a long while because I've determined that the way
the market is turning, I don't want a job in tech, I want an opportunity in tech. That means
going solo indie dev and mastering something that will take me where I want to be. As a solo
dev, a real WORA (write once run anywhere) platform is what I need. After long thought, Dart and
Flutter is that platform. So here we go again. ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“
