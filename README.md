# LEARNING DART AND FLUTTER
This repository is dedicated to my learning of Dart and in the longer run Flutter. 

## PURPOSE

I've decided to dedicate my time to the Google technologies of Go, Dart, and Flutter. Staying 
in the Google family I feel I'll get a more rounded out focus for where I want to end up.
With Go as my low-level, back-endy, embeddable, systems language and Dart and Flutter as my
UI, Mobile, also embeddy, Web language, I'll be good to go on all fronts.
