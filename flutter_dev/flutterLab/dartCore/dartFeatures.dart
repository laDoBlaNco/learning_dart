Dart Core - Features

  ▪ Object-Oriented - Dar is an object-oriented language, which means it focuses on organizing
    code into classes and objects. This approach enables devs to model real-world entities
    and interactions, promoting code reusabiltiy and maintainability.

  ▪ Strongly Typed - Dart is a statically typed language, meaning variable types are known at
    compile-time. This helps catch errors early in the dev process and improves code robustness
    and performance. 

  ▪ Just-In-Time and Ahead-Of-Time Compilation - Dart supports both JIT and AOT compilation. During
    development, dart uses JIT compilation, which allows for features like Hot Reload in flutter, 
    enabling rapid iteration an development. In production, Dart can be compiled to native machine
    code using AOT compilation, resulting in highly performant and efficient Apps.

  ▪ Garbage Collection - Dart has automatic memory management through a garbage collector, which
    automatically deallocates memory that is no longer in use. This helps developers focus on
    application logic without worrying about manual memory management.

  ▪ Asynchronous Programming - Dart provides built-in support for aync programming using features
    like async and await. This makes it easier to handle time-consuming operations, such as network
    reuests and file I/O, without blocking the main thread.

  ▪ Rich Standard Library - Dart comes with a comprehensive standard library that includes utilities
    for working with collections, handling I/O, managing concurrency, and more. This extensive 
    library simplifies development and reduces the need for third-party dependencies in many cases.
