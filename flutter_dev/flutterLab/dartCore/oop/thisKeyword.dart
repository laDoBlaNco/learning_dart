/**
 * Dart Core - Object Oriented Programming - 'this' Keyword
 * 
 * The this keyword refers to the current instance (object) of my
 * class. It is used to access class members (varibles and methods)
 * and avoid naming conflicts between local variables and instance
 * variables. When a class member's name is the same as a local variable's
 * name, using 'this' ensures that I'm referring to the class member.

  // first time I see 'new' in action, meaning its
  // possible to use but not used much in the wild
