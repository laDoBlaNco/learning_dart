/**
 * Dart Core - Object Oriented Programming - 'static' Keyword
 * 
 * In Dart, the 'static' keyword is used to define class members (variables and methods)
 * that belong to the class itself rather than to an instance (object) of the class.
 * (math.pow is a good example from lua). It means that static members are shared
 * across all instances of the class and can be accessed directly without creating
 * an instance of the class.
 * 
 * A static variable is a class-level variable that is shared by all instances of the
 * class. I declare a static variable using the 'static' keyword before its data type.
 * 
 * A static method is a class-level method (function) that can be called directly on the 
 * class without creating an instance of the class. I declare a static method using 
 * the 'static' keyword before its return type.
