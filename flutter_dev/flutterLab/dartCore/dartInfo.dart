Dart is an open sourced, object oriented, class based programming language developed by Google.
It was first introduced in 2011 and has since become the primary language for building apps
using the flutter framework. Dart is designed to be simple, fast, and scalable, making it 
suitable for a wide range of use cases, including web development, mobile app development,

type language), and more.
