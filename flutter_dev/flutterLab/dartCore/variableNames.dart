Dart Core - Variable Names

In dart, variable names must adhere to certain rules and constraints. Following these
guidelines ensures that my code is well-formed and will avoid any conflicts with 
reserved keywords or other programming elements. Here are the variable name constraints
in Dart:

  ▪ Variable names must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z) or an underscore _. They
    can't begin with a number or any other special character.
    ▪ Valid:
      ▪ age, _name, totalScore, _count
    ▪ Invalid:
      ▪ 123abc, %discount, @123, !123

  ▪ After that first character, variable names can contain letters, digits (0-9), and underscores
    ▪ Valid:
      ▪ item1, userName, max_length
    ▪ Invalid:
      ▪ user-name
      ▪ 2_value
      ▪ 3-value

  ▪ Variables are case-sensitive. This means that 'Age', 'age', and 'AGE' are treated as 3 
    different variable names. 

  ▪ I should avoid using reserved keywords as variable names. Reserved keywords ar words that
    have special meanings in the programming language and cannot be used as identifiers.
    ▪ int  - is a reserved keyword in dart for example

  ▪ Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful to enhance the readability and
    maintainability of my code. I should choose names that accurately represent the purpose
    or meaning of the variable. 
    ▪ Good: userName
    ▪ Bad: un

  ▪ Spaces and special chars (except underscores _ ) aren't allowed in variable names
    ▪ Invalid names: user name, total-score, my-variable!
