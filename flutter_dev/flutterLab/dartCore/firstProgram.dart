Dart Core - Dart Program

In dart, void main() is the entry point of any dart application. It is a special function that serves
as the starting point of the program's execution. When the dart program is run, the dart runtime
automatically calls the main function, and the execution of the program begins from there.
  ▪ If there is no 'main' function than we get a compilation error

void main() {
  print('Hello Lado Productions!');
}

/*

▪ void - the return type  of the function, void stands for nothing which means that this function
  will return nothing. Example of other types of return types can be int, String, bool, etc

▪ main - in dart 'main()' is a sepcial fucntion that serves as the entry point of any Dart application.
  When I run a dart program, the dart runtime automatically calls the main function, and the execution
  of the program begins from there. The main function is required in every Dart application, and it is 
  the starting point of the program's execution.

▪ {} - curly braces are used to enclose a group of statements that are executed when the program starts
  running. The main function in Dart serves as teh entry point of the application, and any code within
  the curly braces will be executed when the program runs.

▪ print - in dart, print() is a built-in function used to output data to the console or terminal.
  it is commonly used for debugging purposes, display messages, and logging information during
  the development process. The print() function takes one or more arguments (dart or objecxts) and
  displays their string representation in the console.
