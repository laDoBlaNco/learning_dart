INTRODUCTION: DEFINITIONS AND FEATURES

Flutter:
  ▪ Flutter is an open-sourced software development kit (SDK) created by Google. It is
    used to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a
    single codebase. Launched in may 2017, flutter has rapidly gained popularity among
    devs due to its efficiency, versatility, and ability to deliver high-performance
    visually appealing and fast applications.

Features:
  ▪ Cross Platform Development - flutter enables devs to create applications that can run
    on multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, web, and desktop, with a single codebase
    This saves development time and resources, as devs no longer need to maintain separate
    codebases for different platforms.

  ▪ Expressive UI - flutter provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets and a flexible UI
    framework that allows devs to build beautiful, custom, and responsive user interfaces
    It empowers devs to create visually stunning apps that match the platform's native look
    and feel.

  ▪ Hot Reload - Oen of the most loved features of flutter is its hot'reload capability,
    which allows devs to instantly view changes made to the code without rebuilding the
    entire application. This significantly speeds up the dev process and facilitates rapid
    experimentation and debugging.

  ▪ Dart Programming Language - Futter uses dart, a modern and easy-to-use programming lang
    developed by Google as well. Dart is optimized  for client-side development and helps
    devs write clean, concise, and efficient code. 

  ▪ Performance - Flutter's architecture and rendering engine provide impressive performance,
    resulting in smooth animations and responsive user experiences. The framework is designed 
    to t ake advantage of hardware acceleration, enabling applications to run at native speeds.

  ▪ Rich Ecosystem - Flutter boasts a vibrant and growing ecosystem of packages, plugins, and
    extensions contributed by the community. These resources help devs integrate various
    functionalities, such as databases, APIs, and third-party services, seamlessly into their apps.

  ▪ Strong Community Support - The flutter community itself is highly active and supportive. Devs
    can find a wealth of tutorials, documentation, and online forum to see assistance, share
    knowledge, and collaborate on projects.

Flutter has been used to develop a wide r ange of apps, from simple mobile apps to complex and 
feature-rich enterprise solutions. Its popularity continues to grow, making it a favored choice
for devs and businesses alike, seeking to create robust, versatile, and visually captivating 
apps across multiple platforms.
