  /*
  Key Points:
    â€¢ code comments are denoted by a line starting with //, or multiple
      lines bookended with /* and */.
    â€¢ Documentation comments are denoted by a line starting with ///.
      or multple lines bookended with /** and  */.
    â€¢ I can use 'print' to write to the debug console
    â€¢ The arithmetic operators are:
      â€¢ Addition: +
      â€¢ Subtraction: -
      â€¢ Multiplication: *
      â€¢ Division: /
      â€¢ Truncating Division: ~/
      â€¢ Modulo (remainder): %
    â€¢ Dart has many functions including min, max, sqrt, sin, and cos. I'll learn
      many more throughout this book
    â€¢ Constants and variables give names to data
    â€¢ Once I've declared a constant, I can't change its data, but I can change a 
      variable's data at any time
    â€¢ If a variable's type  can be inferred, I can replace the type with the 'var'
      keyword
    â€¢ The 'const' keyword is used for compile-time constants while 'final' is used
      for runtime constants
    â€¢ Always give variables and constants meaningful names to save myself and my
      colleagues headaches later
    â€¢ Operators that perform arithmetic operations, and then assign back to the 
      variable are:
      â€¢ Add and assign: +=
      â€¢ Subtract and assign: -=
      â€¢ Multipy and assign: *=
      â€¢ Divide and assign: /=
      â€¢ Increment by 1: ++
      â€¢ Decrement by 1: --
