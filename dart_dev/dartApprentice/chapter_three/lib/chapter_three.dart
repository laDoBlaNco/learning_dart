/* Chapter 3: Types & Operations

The root of all types is the Object type. This type defins a few core operations
such as testing for equality and describing the object in text (.toString()). Every
other type in Dart is a subtype (subclass) of Object, and as a subtype shares 
Object's basic functionality.

  final double myDouble3 = 3.14;

  // NOTE: Mutalble data is conventient to work with because I can change it
  // any time I like. However, many experience softward engineers have come to
  // appreciate the benefits of immutable data. When a value is immutable, that
  // means I can trust that no one will change that value after I create it. Limiting
  // my data in this way prevents many hard-to-find bugs from creeping in, and also
  // makes the program easier to reason about and to test.

  NOTE: There are times when I'll waant (or need) to explicitly include the type
  either because Dart doesn't have enough information to figure it out, or because
  I want my intent to be clear to the reader. However, I'll see type inference used
  for most code examples in the book and in the wild.

  /*
  NOTE: In this case, assigning the decimal value to the integer results in a LOSS 
  OF PRECISION: The integer variable ends up with the value 3 instead of 3.14. This
  is why it's important to be explicit. Dart wants to make sure that I know what I'm
  doing and that I may end up losing data by performing the type conversion

  // Casting down
  num someNumber = 3;
  // print(someNumber.isEven); // error since there is no .isEven for supertype 'num'
  // num is too general a type to know anything about even or odd numbers. Only
  // ints can be even or odd; so the issue is that num could potentially be a double
  // at runtime, since num includes both double and int (generic). In this case, though,
  // I'm sure that 3 is an int, so I can 'type cast' it to int
  final someInt = someNumber as int;
  print(someInt.isEven);

  // Be careful though to avoid runtime errors
  // final someDouble = someNumber as double; // it compiles!
  // but as soon as I run the file I get "type 'int' is not a subtype of type 'double' in type cast"

  // NOTE: In Dart you can only cast down. You can't cast to a sibling type as in
  // int to double, etc. for that you use toDouble() or toInt()

  // Strings
  // At its base, a computer needs to be able to translate a character into the
  // computer's own language, and it does this by assigning each character a
  // different number. This forms a two-way mapping from char to number that's
  // called a CHARACTER SET

  // Unicode - defines the character set mapping that almost all computers use
  // today

  // The number associated with each character is called a CODE POINT, so for
  // example 'c' uses code point 99, 'a' uses code point 97, etc

  // NOTE: The workd 'emoji' comes from the Japenese Áµµ‚ΩÇÂ≠ó, where 'e' means
  // picture and 'moji' means character

  // The numbers for characters are sometiems written in decimal notation, but
  // usually I'll see them in hexadecimal format. Using base-16 makes the
  // numbers more compact, easier to find in the Unicode character code charts
  // and generally nicer to work with in programming

  // Working with strings in Dart
  print('');
  print('Hello, Dart!'); // a string literal
  var greeting = 'Hello, Dart!';
  print(greeting.runtimeType);

  // Strings are immutable in Dart.

  // Getting characters
  // Dart doesn't have characters or char type in itself. So 'a' is still a String
  // Dart strings are a collection of UTF-16 code units. UTF-16 is a way to encode
  // Unicode values by using 16-bit numbers. If I need to find out what those codes
  // are, I can do so like this:
  var salutation = 'Hello!';
  print(salutation.codeUnits);

  // UTF-16 has a special way of encoding code points higher than 65,536 (16-bits)
  // by using two code units called surrogate pairs
  const dart = 'üéØ';
  print(dart.codeUnits);

  // The code point for üéØ is 127919, but the surrogate pair for that in UTF-16 is
  // 55356 and 57263. Since no one wants to mess wwith surrogate pairs, there is a
  // nicer way to get Unicode points directly. Like in Go, Dart calls them RUNES

  print(dart.runes);

  // Language is messy, and so is Unicode
  // With some emojis even .runes will give me two Unicode code points. Because
  // Unicode doesn't create a new code point every time there is a new country flag
  // It uses a pair of code points called REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOLS to represent
  // a flag.

  // And they can get big!
  const family = 'üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶';
  print(
    family.runes,
  ); // this list of code points is a man, a woman, a girl, and a boy
  // all glued together with a Zero Width Joiner (ZWJ) 8205

  // So what would the length of that be?
  print(family.length);
  print(family.codeUnits.length);
  print(family.runes.length);
  // the first is each surrogate pair (4*2) and the 3 zwj which = 11
  // the last one gives us the 7 unicode points that make up the emoji
  // one for each (man, woman, girl, boy) and the zwjs = 7

  // When a string with multiple code points looks like a single character, this
  // is known as a 'user perceived character'. In tech terms its called a
  // Unicode extended grapheme cluster, or just a grapheme cluster

  // Adding the characters package to help. Add chracters to the pubspec
  // Now I can handle grapheme clusters
  print(family.characters.length);
  // The characters package (type or class) extends String to include a collection
  // of grapheme clusters called characters

  /*
  At runtime, Object? and dynamic behave nearly identical. However, when I explicitly
  declare a variable as Object?, I'm telling the world that I've generalized the variable
  on purpose, and that they'll need to check its type at runtime if they want to do 
  anything specific with it. Using dynamic, I'm telling that world that I don't know 
  what the variable type is and they can use it however they want to, but it's 
  completely on them if their code crashes. JS anyone?!

  NOTE: That '?' at the end of Object? means that the type can include a null value.

Key points:
  ‚ñ™ Type conversion allows me to convert values of one type to another
  ‚ñ™ When doing operations with basic arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/) and 
    mixed types, the result will be a double
  ‚ñ™ Type inference allows me to omit the type when Dart can figure it out
  ‚ñ™ Unicode is the standard representation for mapping characters to 
    numbers
  ‚ñ™ Dart uses UTF-16 values known as code units to encode Unicode strings
  ‚ñ™ A single mapping in Unicode is called a code point, which is known as
    a rune in Dart (and Go)
  ‚ñ™ User perceived characters may be composed of one or more code points
    and are called grapheme clusters
  ‚ñ™ I can combine strings by using the addition (+) operator (concatenation)
  ‚ñ™ I can make multi-line strings using three single or double quotes
  ‚ñ™ I can use string interpolation to build a string in-place
  ‚ñ™ Dart is an optionally-typed language. While it's preferable to choose
    statically-typed variables, I may write Dart code in a dynamically-typed way 
    by explicitly adding the 'dynamic' type annotation in front of variables
    or using Object? to make them generic.
