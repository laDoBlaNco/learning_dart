The Hours on Wenderlich Way:

Imagine I live in a house at 321 Lonely Lane. All I have at home are a few brownies,
which I absentmindedly munch on as I score the internet looking for work. Finally, I
get a job as a senior Flutter  dev, so I buy a new house at 122 Wenderlich Way. Best
of all, my neighbor  Ray brings over some cookies, cupcakes, donuts, and pie as a 
house warming gift!  The brownies are still at my old place, but in my excitement
about the move I've forgotten all about them. 

Using 'var' is like giving me permission to move houses. The first house had brownies.
The second house had cookies, cupcakes, donuts and pie. Different houses, different
desserts. 

Using 'final', on the other hand, is like saying, "Here's my house, but this is the
last place I can ever live." However, just because I live at a fixed location doesn't
mean that I can't change what's INSIDE the house. I might live permanently at 122 
Wenderlich Way, but its fine to eat all the cookies and cupcakes in the hosue and then 
go to the store and bring home some ice cream. Well, its fine in that it's permissable,
but maybe i should pace myself a bit on the sweets

So too with a 'final' list. Even though the memory address is constant, the values
at that address are still mutable. Mutable data is nice and all, but when I open my
cupboard expecting to find donuts but instead discover the neighbors kids traded them
for slugs, ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤® it's not to pleasant. It's the same list -- sometimes i just won't
appreciated the surprise. So to avoid this I need to create a DEEPLY IMMUTABLE LIST

This is done with 'const'

/*Code as UI - (Flutter enters into the picture)

  The Flutter framework chose Dart because of its unique characterstics. However,Flutter
  has also influenced the development of Dart ðŸ¤” One area I can see this is with the
  addition of the SPREAD OPERATOR, COLLECTION IF and COLLECTION FOR. 

  They make it easier for Flutter devs to compose user interface layouts completely in 
  code, without the need for a separate markup language. The secret of Flutter.

  Flutter UI code is composed of classes (types) called WIDGETS. Three common Flutter
  widgets are rows, columns and stacks, which all store their children as List collections.
  Being able to manipulate lists using the SPREAD OPERATOR, COLLECTION IF and COLLECTION FOR
  makes its easier  to build the UI with code.

  The examples above in 'main' use strings, but in a Flutter app I would see the same
  things with lists of Text, Icon, ElevatedButton and other Widget elements. Which I've
  already seen in Coursera, and YouTube, etc.

/*Higher Order Methods
  There are a number of collection operations common to many programming languages
  including transforming, filtering and consolidating elements of the collection. 
  These operations are known as HIGHER ORDER METHODS, because they take functions
  (usually anony functions) as parameters. I learned about this in Chapter 5, so now
  its time to see it in action.
    â–ª map
    â–ª where/filter
    â–ª reduce/fold
    â–ª sort  
   */

/*NOTES: IMPORTANT
  â–ª I shoul use a COMMANDING VERB for a method that produces a side effect. The sort() 
    method mutates itself, which is a side effect. Also notice the parenthesis on the
    sort method; they clearly say that this is a method, not a property, and as such
    may be doing some potentially expensive and/or dangerous work

  â–ª In comparison, reversed is a getter property, which I recognize because it doesn't
    have any ()s. Thsi indicates that the work is lighter, usually since getters only
    return a value. Additionally, reversed is an ADJECTIVE, not a COMMANDING VERB. That's
    because there are no side effects as it doesn't mutate the collection. 

These are just general guidlines as some don't follow this convention.*/

/*NOTE
  One interesting characteristic of iterables is that they're lazy. That means they
  don't do any work until I ask them to. Since reversed returns an iterable, it doesn't 
  actually reverse the elements of the collection until I try to access those elements,
  such as by printing the collection or converting it to a list using .toList(). 
  Understanding this can help me put off work that doesn't need to be done yet*/
