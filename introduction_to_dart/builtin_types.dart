/// Dart has special support the following types
///   - Numbers (int,double)
///   - Strings (String)
///   - Records ((value1,value2))
///   - Lists (List, also known as arrays)
///   - Sets (Set)
///   - Maps (Map)
///   - Runes (Runes, often replaced by the characters API)
///   - Symbols (Symbol)
///   - The value null (Null)
///
/// this includes the ability to create type literals. 'this is a string'
///
/// There are other types also that have special roles in Dart
///   - Object - like js is the superclass of all dart classes except Null
///   - Enum - The superclass of all enums
///   - Iterable - Used in for-in loops and in sychronous generator funcs
///   - Future and Stream - used in async support
///   - Never - indicates tha an expression can never finish evaluating successfully
///     Normally used with functions that always throw exceptions
///   - dynamic - indicates that we want to disable static checking. Better to use
///     OBject or Object?
///   - void - indicates that a value is never used. Often used as a return type

/// SYMBOLS - object that reps an operator or identifier declared in a dart
/// program. We might never need to use symbols, but they are invaluable for 
/// apis that refer to identifiers by name, because minification changes identifier
/// names but not identifier symbols.  To get the symbol for an identifier, use
/// a symbol literal, which is just # followed by the identifier
/// #radix
/// #bar
/// 
/// Symbol literals are compile-time constants as well.
